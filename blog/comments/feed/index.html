		<description>First, the site is beautiful.  Kudos to the designer who clearly inherited some artistic genes.  Second, I am so wildly impressed with the weekend you have designed for spinners.  Jan, you are so talented in so many ways.  Third, I&#039;d love to meet up and create sometime.  I&#039;ll work on that.</description>
